
Initialize a List for Matches: A list named matches is initialized. This list will store details about every matched phrase: its start and end positions in the conversation, the actual phrase, and its designated color.

Iterate Through Phrases: For each group of phrases in the provided phrases_color_map dictionary, the function iterates through them. Each group might contain multiple comma-separated phrases.

Find Matches in the Conversation: For every individual phrase in a group, the function uses a regular expression to find all occurrences of that phrase in the conversation, regardless of its case (uppercase/lowercase).

Add Details of Matches: For each identified match of a phrase, its details (start position, end position, the phrase, and its color) are added to the matches list.

Sort Matches for Processing: Once all matches are identified, they are sorted. The sorting prioritizes matches based on their start position in the conversation. In case of overlaps, longer matches are prioritized.

Initialize the Result List: An empty list named highlighted_components is created. This list will store both the highlighted and non-highlighted segments of the conversation.

Process Sorted Matches: For each match in the sorted matches list, the function checks if the start of this match is after the end of the previously processed match to avoid overlaps.

Append Unhighlighted Text: If the start of the match is valid (i.e., doesnâ€™t overlap with the previous match), the function appends the portion of the conversation from the end of the last processed match up to the start of the current match to the highlighted_components list. This segment of the conversation is not highlighted.

Apply Highlight to Match: The matched phrase is wrapped in a Dash HTML component that will change its font color and style based on its color in the phrases_color_map. This highlighted component is then appended to the highlighted_components list.

Append Remaining Text: Once all matches have been processed, any remaining text in the conversation after the last match is appended to the highlighted_components list without highlighting.

Return Results: The function returns the highlighted_components list, which now contains a mix of highlighted matched phrases and unhighlighted portions of the conversation.
